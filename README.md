# Redesign sensor interface using 0.18 μm CMOS (Nominal)

This my project when I had course at UCSD

The report is named as "Project Report"

● properly size all of the MOSFETs and resistors to meet the specific requiements.

● Calculation of key design parameters, such as gm, bias currents, etc. Compare the most relevant hand calculations with the final SPICE values in a table and discuss the discrepancies.

 
● Bode plot simulation results. Clearly annotate achieved DC gain, bandwidth, and phase margin.
